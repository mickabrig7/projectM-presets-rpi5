# projectM-presets-rpi5
This is a collection of famous Milkdrop / ProjectM presets that have been stripped off of anything that runs under 24 FPS on my Pi 5.

Everything is based off a very crude benchmark on [my fork of ProjectMSDL](https://github.com/mickabrig7/frontend-sdl2).
You can find the compiled results for each presets pack on [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HcJglDNg9wrV1jdvBZlePkaTG3s7l0NW4giki5oAQhE/edit?usp=sharing) (everything in this repository was generated just by deleting all presets that didn't reach an Average FPS of at least 24).

You are encouraged to use this with the awesome [RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver](https://github.com/kholbrook1303/RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver) !
